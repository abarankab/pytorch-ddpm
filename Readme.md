# Surrogate Diffusion and IWDIFF

This repository contains the code for Surrogate Diffusion and IWDIFF proposed in my coursework. 

Surrogate Diffusion is a method that combines diffusion models with other generative models, GANs in this example. It achieves a linear tradeoff in FID between the two models.

IWDIFF is an importance-weighted objective for DDPMs. It's designed following the IWAE approach.
