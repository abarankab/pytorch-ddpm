    A distribution over timesteps in the diffusion process, intended to reduce

    By default, samplers perform unbiased importance sampling, in which the
    objective's mean is unchanged.
    However, subclasses may override sample() to change how the resampled
    terms are reweighted, allowing for actual changes in the objective.
